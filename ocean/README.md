# DeFiChain Ocean API Development

Ocean API, DeFiChain publicly hosted API for building of Native DeFi application.

## Motivation

> https://github.com/DeFiCh/jellyfish/issues/580

As part of [#580](https://github.com/DeFiCh/jellyfish/issues/580) consolidation efforts. We had multiple projects that
were extensions of the jellyfish project. The separated projects allowed us to move quickly initially but proves to be a
bottleneck when it comes to development.

By including Ocean API development with jellyfish, it creates better synergy of DeFiChain open source development across
concerns. Singular versioning, source of truth, documentation of entirety of defichain
via [jellyfish.defichain.com](https://jellyfish.defichain.com).
